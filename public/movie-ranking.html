<h1>The Best Movies According to Joci</h1>
<h2>Three movies that I highly recommend to watch.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>1. Wreck-It Ralph</h3>
<p>I love everything about the Wreck-It Ralph movie and I feel like everyone should watch it at least once. I'm a big video game fan, but that's 
    only one of the smaller reasons why I love this movie. It's an incredible and unique story of a video game villan who decides he doesn't want to
    be a villan anymore. I feel like the storytelling in this movie is immaculate. There was clearly a lot of thought and effort put into creating 
    such an engaging, surprising, and refreshing story. The way they tell the story of a character struggling with the world's labels and expectations
    in the world of a video game arcade is so fun. Also, every time I watch this movie, which has been well over ten times, I feel like I notice a new
    detail in the animation and design of the movie that I hadn't previously noticed. Every character design, block, and pixel was carefully planned
    out to be intentionally and purposefully made to fit the story and the environment of the movie.</p>
<h3>2. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</h3>
<p>The way this movie was crafted, from the animation to the story, really went beyond my expectations. I found this animated movie to be such an 
    intriguing and exciting new style of animation that combines the comic book look and feel to an extremely beautifully animated film. The vibrant
    colours and animation styling is so unique and very detailed. I also found the story of a rag tag group of Spider-Man alter egos to be really 
    different and fun to watch.</p>
<h3>3. Marriage Story</h3>
<p>This movie is a very unfiltered depiction of the story of a couple who are going through a divorce. I enjoyed how powerfully raw the movie was told
    and shot. It felt incredibly realistic and vulnerable in a way that was almost uncomfortable because of how tragic the story seemed. There was no 
    sugar coating or hiding any of the struggle that the two main characters had to face. I liked that the characters were imperfect because it made
    the story seem all the more real.</p>
